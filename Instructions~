*Conect via ethernet cable direct to the laptop:
	1- Configute your ethernet to share over IPv4 config
	2- Power of your Pi without the ethernet cable
	3- Wait for a while until you guess that the Pi you fully booted
	4- Conect your ethernet cable in the Pi and in the laptop
	5- In the laptop terminal run "cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases" to get the 
	IP address of your Pi in the shared network
	6- Run "ssh pi@xx.xx.xx.xx" where "xx.xx.xx.xx" is the address the you get in step 4

*Copy files via ssh:
	1- Copy one single local file to a remote destination:
		- run "scp /path/to/source-file user@host:/path/to/destination-folder/" 
		in the host
		- EXAMPLE: So, if you wan to copy the file /home/user/table.csv to a 
		remote host named host.example.com and copy there to jane's home folder,
		 use this command.
			scp /home/user/table.csv jane@host.example.com:/home/jane/
	2- Copy one single file from a remote server to your current local server:
		- run "scp user@host:/path/to/source-file /path/to/destination-folder" in the host
		- EXAMPLE: Let's say now you want to copy the same file from jane's home folder in 
		host.example.com to your local home folder.
			scp jane@host.example.com:/home/jane/table.csv /home/user/

* Testing the camera
	Before we dive into the code, letâ€™s run a quick sanity check to ensure 
	that our Raspberry Pi camera is working properly.
		run "raspistill -o output.jpg"
